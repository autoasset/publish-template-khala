### vd2svg

Android vector drawable to SVG converter.
This tool could help you extract all android vectors to SVG and display in any file browser.

### Installation

Easiest way is to install via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vd2svg)
```bash
npm install vd2svg -g
```

Another way is to clone this repo and install locally:

```bash
./gradlew jdeployInstall
```

### Usage

The program skips all non-vector xml.

```bash
cd ~/your/drawable/folder
vd2svg *.xml
```

If you are using colors from resource files, then need point to colors file.

```bash
cd ~/your/drawable/folder
vd2svg -r ../values *.xml
``` 

`-r` scans a directory recursively and searches for color values.
It also could point to the concrete file.

### Advance usage

If you want fast preview all vectors and your file browser doesn't support SVG, you could convert them to png using [imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/)

```bash
vd2svg *.xml
mogrify -format png -density 1200 "*.svg"
```
